        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p style="text-indent: 20px"> Hello! My name is Alexandria Allmond, and I am a twenty-nine year old native of Memphis, TN. I am a recent graduate of Tech901's IT Foundations course, and an alumna of The University of Tennessee Knoxville. I began my journey with IT in April of 2019, and I have had nothing short of an amazing experience. I have been able to not only meet some wonderful people, but have been able to learn and interact with other IT organizations in the area. Recently, I learned about and volunteered with a non-profit organization in Memphis, TN at St. Jude, called Black Girls Code. The local chapter of Black Girls Code focuses on helping young African American girls learn more about STEM education and the coding world. Along with my interest in IT, I am also a huge foodie and lover of animals! If there is food (and let's be clear here--Memphis definitely has some great food), or an animal that needs rescuing, I'm there without a doubt. I currently own three dogs that I have rescued: a Beagle, a Chihuahua, and a Yorkie, and have helped a local rescue save countless others. In the next few years, I hope to become a great web developer and to open my own dog rescue. I am anxious to see what is in store for my future! </p>
